				<h2>Rules</h2>
                    All members in good standing of the CRR, PTC and TS may participate. Runners must register with the Hampton Roads Super Grand Prix to be included in event scoring. Registration may take place at any time during the year until only 5 races remain on the schedule but only races run after registration will be counted. While there is no cost to participate in scoring, club dues and race entry fees are the responsibility of the participant.
                    
                    <ul>
                               	<li>Each club will select 4 or more club supported races for inclusion in the Grand Prix.</li>
                                <li>Grand Prix races may vary in distance from 1 mile to 50K.</li>
								<li>Only club members who contact the Grand Prix Coordinator <a href="contact.html">HERE</a> will be tracked in the Super Grand Prix.</li>
								<li>A runner must be a club member in good standing and complete a minimum 5 out of the 15 races.</li>
								<li>You do not need to score in 5 races, just complete 5. Points are awarded for placing 1st through 5th (20, 15, 12, 10, 8) in your Grand Prix age group. See <a href="scoring.html">Scoring</a> for more details.</li>
								<li>At least 1 run from each of the 3 club's races must be run.</li>
								<li>Your age on July 1st determines your Grand Prix age. Divisions will consist of Overall Men & Women, Masters Men & Women (40 and over) and Age Group Men & Women.</li>
								<li>Age groups are 19 and under, and five year spreads after that (i.e. 20-24, 25-29, 30-34 & so on, up to 70 and Over).</li>
								<li>End of year awards will be given to the top three finishers in each age group and to the top three in the overall and masters divisions.</li>
								<li>A runner is eligible for only one award. The Grand Prix committee reserves the right to substitute races in the event of a cancellation.</li>
								<li>You must complete the Grand Prix event in the time allotted for the event in order to earn points. For example, if it is a 5k and the course limit is 1 hour you must complete that event in 1 hour.</li>
								</ul>

                    <h4>Results and standings will be posted after each event.
                                <br>They may also be reported in the respective clubs’ newsletters.
								<br>Awards will be presented at each club’s awards banquet in early 2018.</h4>
                    
                    <p>Runners will be scored within traditional 5 year age groups, masters and overall for both males and females, going 3 deep.  Age groups will start at “19 and Under” and go through “70 and Up”.  Runners placing in overall and masters at the end of the season will be pulled out of their age groups.
For each race, points will be awarded amongst registered Super GP participants:</p>
											<ul>
                                            <li>1st place, 20 points</li>
											<li>2nd place, 15 points</li>
											<li>3rd place, 12 points</li>
											<li>4th place, 10 points</li>
											<li>5th place, 8 points</li>
                                            </ul>
<p>Each series participant must run a minimum of 5 of the 12 races to qualify for awards. However, in age group competition, points from all races run will count toward awards. Each runner must run at least one run from the clubs that are not their home club.</p>  
<p>For Overall and Masters Competitions, only the best 5 scores will count, including at least one race from each club. In the case of a tie, a 6th race will be counted, and so on, until the tie is broken. </p>
